This runbook gives hint on how to interpret system log errors. As the kernel log receives unstructured logs of different verbosities and formatting it is very hard to give a definitive guide on how to interpret those. So the following is only a small collection of errors one can easily ignore or one should not ignore.

## ACPI Errors

ACPI errors be them on laptops or servers are usually irrelevant and just indicate the bad ACPI standard compliance and support from vendors. Ignore them.

## blk_update_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector xxxx

Your disk is failing and needs replacement.

## \[Hardware Error]: error_type: 2, single-bit ECC

Your RAM modules might be faulty.

## Hardware event. This is not a software error.

Indicates a hardware problem. You might want to check HW status with `ipmitool`, `mcelog` or `rasdaemon` on the machine or in your ILO / ILOM / IDRAC GUI.

## Buffer I/O error on device

Probably a RAID problem. Check physical devices with `smartctl` and your RAID management tool.

## ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): bond0: link is not ready

Check bond with `nmcli`
